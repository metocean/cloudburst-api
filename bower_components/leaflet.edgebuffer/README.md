# Leaflet.EdgeBuffer
Leaflet plugin to support pre-loading tiles outside the current viewport. It will be compatible with Leaflet master once a change to support a GridLayer tile bounds hook is merged.

## Usage

Include `Leaflet.EdgeBuffer.js`, then add `edgeBufferTiles: 1` to the options of layers you wish to have an edge buffer. 

### Options

 - **edgeBufferTiles**: (number) The number of tiles that should be loaded beyond the edge of the map viewport. This may be a fractional number. Default to undefined, which disabled the feature.


## Demos

This demo shows two maps, one without this plugin active and one with.
